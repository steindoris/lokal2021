                expanding our senses and connecting with the environment. Participants might find a new perspective, 
                a plant-oriented worldview that comes in handy when dealing with global warming, midlife crisis and everyday stress.</p><br>

            <p>About Mannyrkjustöðin (Human expansion station)</p>
            <p>Our goal is to establish a connection with nature and promote selfcare. 
                Plants are excellent teachers and we have much to learn from them. 
                That’s why we say “Everyone has an inner plant” used as a metaphor that can help us in dealing with feelings, 
                relationships etc.</p><br>

            <p>Hrefna Lind Lárusdóttir is a performance artists that works across discipline, performance, visual art, 
                music and design. Hrefna’s work is about creating a space where the surreal meets the mundane, 
                where she feels like there is a potential for a juxtaposition and a gap for further conversation 
                about how we perceive the ordinary things in life. Hrefna is a co-founder of the Post Performance Blues Band, 
                The Plant becoming project, where people can grow their inner plant and curates and teaches artwork in prisons 
                within the project Breaking barriers. Hrefna studied contemporary performance at Naropa University and Art academy of Iceland.</p>
            <p>Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson is a designer who has been researching the connection of design with other forms of art and examined how 
                ideas about design can be used in a new context. Recently, he has been exploring the boundaries of performance and design, 
                where the qualities of the magnificent moment are brought into everyday life. The scenery, props, costumes and progressions 
                weave into the urban landscape and participants get to explore the adventures that surround us.</p> 

            <p>Búi graduated from psychology at the University of Iceland, product design from the Iceland Academy of the Arts and social 
                design and art from the Design Academy in Eindhoven. Búi is also a co-founder and service representative of Plant Becoming Project.</p>
