            <h1>WOMEN WHO CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN </h1>
            <p>How many children do you want to have? When are you having children? What? You don’t want to have children? That will change when you get older, believe me. 
                You know you don’t have all the time in the world. You will change your mind when you have your first child. You won’t regret it. No one regrets it. 
                What? Are you tired? But you have no children. Just imagine if you had three children. Then you would be tired. But kids are so lovely. 
                They give life meaning. You will not regret having children.</p><br>

            <p>BUT I DON’T WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN!</p><br>
            <p>Iris’s research based performance dives into the world of women you choose not to have children and their experiences living as women in a world that idealizes motherhood. 
                The performance is based on Iris’s interviews with women who all choose a childfree lifestyle.</p><br>
            <p>Creator: Íris Stefanía Skúladóttir</p><br>
            <p>Thanks to all the women who shared their stories</p><br> 

            <p>Iris is a performance artist and curator who has worked with women's bodies and lives in her work. She emphasizes pleasure, taboo, shame and longing. 
                The right of women to do what they want with their bodies and their lives has been the starting point in Iris's work. Among other things, 
                she has collected and published women's masturbation stories and held story circles where stories related to the subject are told. 
                She has made a radio play about older women and their right to be sexual beings and she is currently working on a show about women who choose not to have children, 
                that will premiere at Lókal 2021. The show, a story circle about the topic, is called But I don’t want to have children. Iris will also have an off venue event about orgasmic births.
