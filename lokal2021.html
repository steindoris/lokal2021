                    <p>Lókal - international theatre festival will be held November 26 - December 6. This year’s program is especially exciting. 
                        In recent years, Lókal has emphasized works in progress. The works range from being first drafts, 
                        or in the middle of a research or development process, to works already premiered. The festival celebrates this delicate rendezvous, 
                        where everything is fragile and we see the working process as exciting and rewarding in itself. Lókal celebrates slowness, 
                        minimal production and artistic pursuit.</p><br />

                    <p>At this year's festival, there are seven Icelandic works, finished ones as well as works in progress, 
                        and one piece from a highly respected foreign performance group.</p><br />

                    <p>Lókal publishes publications this year: Syrpa - a sample of stage scripts, (Syrpa - sýnisrit sviðshandrita) which contains samples of scripts for performing arts, 
                        from the various performing artists in Reykjavík. Supported by Icelandic Literature Center. 
                    </p><br />

                    <p>Lókal holds a Script writing Workshop in collaboration with Reykjavík UNESCO City of Literature and Reykjavík City Library. 
                        Instructors are authors Friðgeir Einarsson and Kristín Eiríksdóttir.</p><br />

                    <p>COVID: To attend the shows in Tjarnarbíó we need the audience to provide a negative rapid antigen test result. 
                        The test is free. You can book one here, the day before: <a href="https://covidtest.is/">https://covidtest.is/                     
                        </a></p>
                    <p>There are also other places to go to.</p><br />
                    <p>Let´s celebrate performances in a responsible way. Remember the mask</p>

                    <p>
                    I want to have a heart to heart conversation with my mother before
                    it’s too late, but I have never been able to make that happen in
                    real life. Until I asked her to help me with a school project.
                    She's very supportive of my education. So now we will meet on
                    stage and try to figure out what we can and can’t talk about. We
                    don’t want to talk about cancer or death but maybe it’s a good
                    time to plan the funeral.

                    Sigríður Eir Zophoníasardóttir or Sigga is a performance artist
                    educated from the Icelandic Academy of the Arts. Sigga is a
                    country girl as she was raised in Hallormsstaður, one of Iceland's
                    very few forests. Her career as a performance artist started with
                    living room performances and concerts for her family where the
                    actors were few, underpaid and often unwillingly participating.
                    Sigga is an emotional being. Her practise is based in processing
                    of personal experience and the subconscious, her own inner life
                    and intuition, where she tries to find the distinction between
                    wisdom and hysteria, the private and public, micro and macro. She
                    zooms in on her personal stories, and sometimes overshares, to
                    make sense of the bigger context of things, hoping that it is of
                    any relevance to others. She is also one of two members of A Band
                    Called Eva, a queer, feminist and slow performance duo and band,
                    who have been performing in the theatre and music scene in Iceland
                    since 2013. They make songs about things that don´t have songs but
                    we need to sing about like collarbones, menstruation blood and
                    female masturbation.

                    How many children do you want to have? When are you having
                    children? What? You don’t want to have children? That will change
                    when you get older, believe me. You know you don’t have all the
                    time in the world. You will change your mind when you have your
                    first child. You won’t regret it. No one regrets it. What? Are you
                    tired? But you have no children. Just imagine if you had three
                    children. Then you would be tired. But kids are so lovely. They
                    give life meaning. You will not regret having children.

                    Iris’s research based performance dives into the world of women
                    you choose not to have children and their experiences living as
                    women in a world that idealizes motherhood. The performance is
                    based on Iris’s interviews with women who all choose a childfree
                    lifestyle.

                    Iris is a performance artist and curator who has worked with
                    women's bodies and lives in her work. She emphasizes pleasure,
                    taboo, shame and longing. The right of women to do what they want
                    with their bodies and their lives has been the starting point in
                    Iris's work. Among other things, she has collected and published
                    women's masturbation stories and held story circles where stories
                    related to the subject are told. She has made a radio play about
                    older women and their right to be sexual beings and she is
                    currently working on a show about women who choose not to have
                    children, that will premiere at Lókal 2021. The show, a story
                    circle about the topic, is called But I don’t want to have
                    children. Iris will also have an off venue event about orgasmic
                    births.

                    "Hunden Bakom Mannen" is a new performance by Losti Collective
                    about the 97 Greenlandic sled dogs who were the first dogs to set
                    their paws on the South Pole.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p>
                    In 1909 two men had the same idea: to be the first humans to walk
                    on the South Pole. One of the men was a British naval officer,
                    named Robert Falcon Scott, and the other man was the Norwegian
                    explorer Roald Amundsen. The two men and their respective teams
                    began to compete for time and raced in the direction of the South
                    Pole as the media back home watched.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                    Scott, the British man, tried reaching his goal by using horses
                    and primitive snowmobiles and subsequently died trying. Amundsen,
                    the Norwegian, got the help of Greenlandic sled dogs to transport
                    him towards the South Pole, a goal that he reached on the 15th of
                    December in 1911. However, this is not the story of these men.

                    <p>
                    This is the story of the 97 dogs upon whom Amundsen based his
                    victory.

                <p>Is it hard to be a human?</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                Then take a break and come on a plant-oriented trip to Reykjanes
                with Mannyrkjustöðin. We tour our guests through a seemingly
                barren landscape looking for plants, expanding our senses and
                connecting with the environment. Participants might find a new
                perspective, a plant-oriented worldview that comes in handy when
                dealing with global warming, midlife crisis and everyday stress.
                </p>

                <p>
                Our goal is to establish a connection with nature and promote
                selfcare. Plants are excellent teachers and we have much to learn
                from them. That’s why we say “Everyone has an inner plant” used as
                a metaphor that can help us in dealing with feelings,
                relationships etc.

                Hrefna Lind Lárusdóttir is a performance artists that works across
                discipline, performance, visual art, music and design. Hrefna’s
                work is about creating a space where the surreal meets the
                mundane, where she feels like there is a potential for a
                juxtaposition and a gap for further conversation about how we
                perceive the ordinary things in life. Hrefna is a co-founder of
                the Post Performance Blues Band, The Plant becoming project, where
                people can grow their inner plant and curates and teaches artwork
                in prisons within the project Breaking barriers. Hrefna studied
                contemporary performance at Naropa University and Art academy of

                Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson is a designer who has been researching
                the connection of design with other forms of art and examined how
                ideas about design can be used in a new context. Recently, he has
                been exploring the boundaries of performance and design, where the
                qualities of the magnificent moment are brought into everyday
                life. The scenery, props, costumes and progressions weave into the
                urban landscape and participants get to explore the adventures
                that surround us.

              The work is an artistic study in which we explore at how nursing
              of spirit and body is integrated, where the threads of art and
              healing come together. A nurse, a poet and musicians come together
              to celebrate and explore the work of healing.

                        Through the making of paintings, accompanied by writing – both, external as a generator of discourse, 
                        but also embedded into the surface of the canvas, he analyses cultural contexts, 
                        historical narratives and modern-day virtual iconoclasm. With the incorporation of peculiar perspectives, 
                        his motifs tackle pertinent political issues and depict the inner strife of a second-generation immigrant, 
                        who became a global citizen after being born into a Western-European country.

                        In a time when our already-strained co-existences and interactions are 
                        further fractured and flattened by virtual gatherings, 
                        A Thousand Ways: Part Two is your chance to reconsider what you think you know about a person– 
                        including yourself. This elucidating experience is the second instalment in a triptych that 
                        explores the lines between strangeness and kinship, distance and proximity. 
                        Everything we need is already here, just you and me.

                        Best friends since six years of age, they have been there for each other but they have also not been there. 
                        This work is a reckoning of the teenage years, a research on coming of age through friendship. 
                        About two hidden worlds from their past; the church youth club and MSN messenger. 
                        They welcome the audience to participate in a Youth Club session in Hallgrímskirkja church basement.

                        This piece is a work in progress, and has been for the past three years, starting as a part of Umbúðalaust project 
                        in Reykjavík City Theatre (Borgarleikhúsið), originally meant to be performed there.

                        Life (and pandemic) has happened quite spectacularly since then, affecting the work and delaying the process. 
                        Since friendship and relationships are ever-evolving, Ásrún and Halla have welcomed this processing-period, 
                        with humility, but are grateful for now having the chance to perform the current version of this work in process, 
                        before an audience.

                        Ásrún Magnúsdóttir was born in Reykjavík in the late eighties. Her work aims to stretch the dominant modes of dance 
                        and choreography and has been received well at home and abroad, as made apparent by her numerous festival appearances, 
                        awards and nominations. Currently, she is interested in working with people that have not given dance or dancing much 
                        thought and trying to make invisible choreographies visible. She is interested in amplifying voices that she feels might 
                        be heard better; giving the stage to other people to speak up, be seen and listened to.
